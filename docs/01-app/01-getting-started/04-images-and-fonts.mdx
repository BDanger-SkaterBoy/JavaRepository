Next.js comes with automatic image and font optimizations for better performance and user experience. This page will guide you through how to start using them.

## Handling Static Assets

You can store static files, like images and fonts, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

## Optmizing images

The Next.js [`<Image>`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) component extends the HTML `<img>` to provide:

- **Size Optimization:** Automatically serving correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.
- **Visual Stability:** Preventing [layout shift](/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) automatically when images are loading.
- **Faster Page Loads:** Only loading images when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.
- **Asset Flexibility:** Resizing images on-demand, even images stored on remote servers.

To start using `<Image>`, first import it from `next/image` and render it within your component.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return <Image src="" alt="" />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return <Image src="" alt="" />
}
```

The `src` property can be a [local](#local-images) or [remote](#remote-images) image.
